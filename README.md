# Mirrador-Carrier
PCB with a 50 ohm grounded Coplanar waveguide and 8 ultra low noise LDOs to supply the Mirador MMIC
this PCB was realized during my internship at IlH Stuttgart from july to september 2024.
It is made of two parts : DC supply and IF Tline

The grounded coplanarwaveguide was studied using ADS with EM simulation

You can also find the excel sheet that I used to calculated set resistance to have the right voltage output for each LDO
